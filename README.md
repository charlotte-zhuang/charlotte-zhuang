# about me

Making LM agents by day, learning Electron.js by night.

## üõ†Ô∏è tool connector (desktop extensions for language models)

Single setup for LM (language model) agent tools on your own machine.

This allows all your desktop LM apps (e.g. Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor) to connect to the same tools rather than having to setup each tool in each app.

I built this as a proof-of-concept to make third-party desktop integrations easier to use after spending all day testing out [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

It's built using [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org) with the goal of making LM tool integration more like installing a Chrome extension and less like setting up a dev environment.

### wordle

A [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) solver I made to learn about C++ and multi-processing.

### coding problems

I've been slowly adding to this repository anything that might be useful for competitive programming. There's also a bit of [experimentation on execution times](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/science). Some highlights:

1. [Heap experiment CLI app](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/heap-experiments)
2. [Simple, standard implementations of algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/useful-code)
3. [Explanations of interesting coding problems](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/explanations)
