Nothing much going on right now.

## projects

Here are some of my favorite personal projects!

### wordle

A parallel [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) solver I wrote in C++ for a class. I'm hoping to make it better soon.

### coding problems

I've been slowly adding to this repository anything that might be useful for competitive programming. There's also a bit of [experimentation on execution times](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/science). Some highlights:

1. [Heap experiment CLI app](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/heap-experiments)
2. [Simple, standard implementations of algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/useful-code)
3. [Explanations of interesting coding problems](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/explanations)
