# about me

I'm a CS and Philosophy student studying at San Jose State University. Welcome to my profile!

## current projects

### SCE discord bot

The Software and Computer Engineering Society's Discord bot. It enables fun and useful commands on Discord servers (where we spend all our time these days). I worked on the threaded messaging feature, and now took over as the project lead from Jerry Lee.

### coding problems

I've been slowly adding to this repository anything that might be useful for competitive programming. There's also a bit of [experimentation on execution times](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/science). Some highlights:

1. [Heap experiment CLI app](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/heap-experiments)
2. [Simple, standard implementations of algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/useful-code)
3. [Explanations of interesting coding problems](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/explanations)

## future

I'd like to do some work on machine learning, which I think would be really interesting. More practice with web is also on the horizon.

1. SCE sentiment analysis bot (TensorFlow, BERT)
2. Portfoilo website (React, Node.js)
3. Breadth First Search Research (C, shell scripts)
