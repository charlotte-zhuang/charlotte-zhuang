# about me

I'm a CS student studying at San Jose State University, minoring in Math and Philosophy.

I'll be busy for a while with internships and schoolwork (at the same time ðŸ¥²) until probably summer of 2023 when I graduate, so I imagine I won't be very active for a while.

## projects

Here are some of my favorite projects!

### wordle

A parallel [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) solver I wrote in C++ for a class. I'm hoping to make it better soon.

[repo](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/wordle)

### coding problems

I've been slowly adding to this repository anything that might be useful for competitive programming. There's also a bit of [experimentation on execution times](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/science). Some highlights:

1. [Heap experiment CLI app](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/heap-experiments)
2. [Simple, standard implementations of algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/useful-code)
3. [Explanations of interesting coding problems](https://github.com/charlotte-zhuang/coding-problems/tree/main/explanations)

### SCE discord bot

The Software and Computer Engineering Society's Discord bot. It enables fun and useful commands on Discord servers (where we spend all our time these days). I worked on the threaded messaging feature, and briefly took over as the project lead from Jerry Lee.

### Kin Kin

A team project for a class. We made a website to help people find kinesology majors who want to work as physical therapists. I touched most parts of the website here and there. Unfortunately, we didn't have very much time to do this project so it's quite rough.

[online site](https://kinkin-cs160.herokuapp.com) - It's hosted on Heroku's free version so it takes a while to start, then you have to refresh and try to login twiceâ€¦
